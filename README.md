# Pacman Ghost Light for Uptime Kuma

This is the [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) code used to build a [Paladone Pac-Man Ghost Light](https://amzn.to/49Cp8EF) whose lights adjust based on the status of monitors in [Uptime Kuma](https://uptime.kuma.pet/).

#### Requirements: 
  - [Uptime Kuma](https://uptime.kuma.pet/).
  - CircuitPython 8.x.
  - Compatible board.
  - Adafruit NeoPixel-compatible RGB LEDs (ie: [WS2812b](https://amzn.to/43dU3Vh)).

All necessary CircuitPython libraries are included in the `code/lib` directory.

#### Optional:
  - [SSD1306-compatible 128x64 display](https://amzn.to/48IWCA0).

Note: The `lib/adafruit_displayio_ssd1306.py` library has been modified at line 57 to increase the scan rate. Should that not work for your display, you can revert the modification or drop in the original from [Adafruit's CircuitPython Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle).

Any board that runs CircuitPython and provides W-Fi, 5v, and 2 pins of GPIO ought to work (plus 3v3 and i2c if using an SSD1306 display). My development setup was on an [Raspberry Pi Pico W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/?variant=raspberry-pi-pico-w) but deployed it with an [ESP-C3-13-Kit](https://amzn.to/3wOrRMG) board â€” that particular ESP board seems to be unobainium today but the [ESP-C3-12F-Kit](https://amzn.to/3PgFWsz) boards appear to be equivalent and are breadboard-friendly in width.

#### Installation:

Copy everything from the `code/` directory to the CircuitPython root.

#### Configuration:

There are settings that MUST be configured for this to work.

* `settings.toml`:

  * `METRICS_URL =` Complete URL to the Prometheus metrics endpoint on your Uptime Kuma instance (ie: http://something/metrics). __Required.__
  * `API_TOKEN =` Your Uptime Kuma API token. Needed if authentication is enabled. See `/settings/api-keys` on your Uptime Kuma instance.
  * `CIRCUITPY_WIFI_SSID =` Wi-Fi SSID. __Required.__
  * `CIRCUITPY_WIFI_PASSWORD =` Wi-Fi password. __Required.__
  * `CIRCUITPY_WEB_API_PORT =` Set to use the CircuitPython Web Workflow (ie: if your board doesn't support the "CIRCUITPY" drive).
  * `CIRCUITPY_WEB_API_PASSWORD =` Password for the CircuitPython Web Workflow (optional).

* `settings.py`:
  * General settings:
    * `interval_refresh =` How often to check Uptime Kuma (in seconds).
    * `interval_timeout =` How long to wait for Uptime Kuma response (in seconds).
    * `use_ntp =` [ True | False ] Set the board clock using NTP.
  * Body LED settings:
    * `use_body_pixels =` [ True | False ]
    * `body_pixels_pin =` GPIO to use for body LEDs.
    * `body_pixels_count =` Number of body LEDs.
    * `body_pixels_brightness =` Body LED brightness, 1 = 100%.
  * Eye LED settings:
    * `use_eye_pixels =` [ True | False ]
    * `eye_pixels_pin =` GPIO to use for eye LEDs.
    * `eye_pixels_count =` Number of eye LEDs.
    * `eye_pixels_brightness =` Eye LED brightness, 1 = 100%.
  * LCD settings:
    * `use_display =` [ True | False ]
    * `scl_pin =` GPIO to use for i2c SCL
    * `sda_pin =` GPIO to use for i2c SDA

Some combination of Body LED, Eye LED, and LCD settings must be configured, or else it won't do anything beyond outputting to the serial port.

#### Modifying:

There are a series of functions prefixed with `action_` which control the LED states:

* `action_Booting:` Startup.
* `action_NoWifi:` Wi-Fi not yet connected.
* `action_HaveWifi:` Wi-Fi has connection.
* `action_Unreachable:` Uptime Kuma unreachable / non-responsive.
* `action_Pending:` Some Uptime Kuma monitors are in the Pending state.
* `action_Outage:` Some Uptime Kuma monitors are in the Outage state.
* `action_Up:` All Uptime Kuma monitors are Up.

For testing purposes, set `loop_light_states = True` in `settings.py` to infinitely loop through the color states.

#### Constructing:

Building and wiring up your Pacman Ghost is an exercise left up to you. Frankly, I barely know what I'm doing, and this is my first completed small electronics / CircuitPython project that does much of anything. The Pacman Ghost easily comes apart with four screws on the back and a bit of prying to release the tabs. Stripping out the guts is a couple more screws. My original proof-of-concept version used a Pico W, 5 RGB LEDs for the body, and recycled the white LEDs for the eyes (always on). My second incarnation runs an ESP-C3-13-Kit, uses 9 RGB LEDs for the body, and adds two more RGB LEDs for the eyes. With the eyes I had to scrape the holes and surface a bit for a good-ish fit and hot glued the RGB LEDs in place.

#### My test rig:

With a screen for debugging, two "eye" and three "body" LEDs.
